This is a module for x8/x10mini/x10minipro for undervolting the
MSM7227 CPU. This is also an extraction from x8overclock for users
who want stability.

It can be applied to any kernel with CONFIG_KALLSYMS.

To make it work with other kernel, just look up kallsyms_lookup_name
offset and change it in the header.
