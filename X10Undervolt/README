This is a module for undervolting the X10 QSD8250 CPU. 
It changes the voltage levels of the available scalling frequencies
in order to save battery.

It can be applied to any kernel with CONFIG_KALLSYMS but has been tested
with SE Eclair Kernel 2.1.A.0.435

To make it work with other kernel, just look up kallsyms_lookup_name
offset and change it in the header.
